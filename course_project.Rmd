# Background and Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, we will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participant They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The five ways are exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Only Class A corresponds to correct performance. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, i.e., Class A to E. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

# Data Processing

## Import and clean data
```{r, load_and_clean_data}
# Load data from
# urlTrain <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
# urlTest <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
# download.file(urlTrain, "data/pml-training.csv", method="curl")
# download.file(urlTest, "data/pml-testing.csv", method="curl")
training = read.csv("data/pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA", "#DIV/0!", " "))
testing = read.csv("data/pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("NA", "#DIV/0!", " "))

# remove rows with NAs
cols_vector <- (colSums(is.na(training))==0)
training <- training[,cols_vector]
testing <- testing[,cols_vector]

# remove useless columns: X, ser_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, 
# cvtd_timestamp, new_window, num_window
trainOrig <- training[,-c(1:7)]
testOrig <- testing[,-c(1:7)]
```

## Data splitting
In order to estimate out of sample error we need to split data into ***training*** (70%) set for training and ***test*** (30%) set for validation.

```{r, split_data}
library(caret); 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=trainOrig$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
train <- trainOrig[inTrain,]
valid <- trainOrig[-inTrain,]
dim(train); dim(valid)
```

## Find variables correlation
After data cleaning we have a training set with 52 variables/predictors. In order to choose the training algorythm we need to find correlation between valiables. 

```{r, find_predictors_importance}
library(corrplot)
set.seed(343007)
# "classe" index is 53
M <- abs(cor(train[,-53]))
diag(M) <- 0 # remove variables correlation with themselves
which(M > 0.9, arr.ind = TRUE)

corrplot(corr=cor(train[, -53]), method = "circle", order="hclust", type='lower', tl.cex=0.5,mar=c(0,2,2,1), 
         tl.col='blue',tl.pos='ld', diag=FALSE, 
         title="Fig. 1 Pairwise correlations of the variables in the training set")
```

Here we have highly correlated variables. Hence we use Random Forest algorythm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general. As far as we have 5 values of "classe" factor variable - we will use 5-fold cross validation when applying the algorithm.

Random Forest is a processor intensive algorythm. That is why we have the following strategies to reduce the computational time.

- Reduce the training set -> cut off the least important variables -> train model again on full training set;
- Reduce the number of trees (*ntree* parameter) that Random Forest tries to compute on full training set, but use all the variables;

## Data modeling
Here we use "reducing the number of trees" strategy and check the accuracy after building a model.

```{r,data_modeling,cache=TRUE}
library(rattle);library(randomForest); library(rpart)
trCtl <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modFit <- train(classe ~., method="rf", trControl=trCtl, data=train, ntree=128)

# get the importance of the variables
varImp <- varImp(modFit)
plot(varImp, main="Fig.2 Variable importance in decreasing order")

modFit
```

Now we estimate the model on the validation data set.
```{r, data_validation}
pred <- predict(modFit, valid)
cfm <- confusionMatrix(valid$classe, pred)
cfm$overall['Accuracy']
```

Accuracy value is pretty well. So let's find out of sample error.
```{r, oose}
1 - as.numeric(cfm$overall['Accuracy'])
```

## Predicting on original testing set
Here we try the model to predict outcome on original testing data set.
```{r, predicting}
predFin <- predict(modFit, testOrig)
predFin
```


# Appendix

Here we plot some additional figures.
```{r,appendix}
plot(modFit, main="Fig.3 Number of selected predictors vs Accuracy")

```
